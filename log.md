# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub account, forked repository, installed Git, cloned repository, edited progress log. 

**Thoughts:** Installing Git was very difficult on Mac OSX. I didn't understand what Clark did to get it to work. `(mv: rename /usr/bin/git to /usr/bin/git-system: Operation not permitted)` Knowledge of terminal is very useful and I will need to refresh and improve my knowledge of it as I learn SQL.
